    <h1>Privacy Policy for My Private Application</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: June 7, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how "My Private Application" (the "Application") handles information when you use it. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Application is designed for **personal, non-commercial use only** and operates primarily as a script to [briefly describe your script's main function, e.g., "access public news feeds, analyze trends, and facilitate content publishing to your own social media accounts"]. It is not a public service or platform.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application **does not collect, store, or share any personal data from third-party users.** All interactions are limited to the specific user (you) running the script and your configured accounts on external platforms.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the Application may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Access Public Data:** Retrieve publicly available information (e.g., news headlines from Google News RSS, trending searches from Google Trends RSS, public tweets, public YouTube videos).</li>
        <li>**Interact with Your Connected Accounts:** Use API keys and access tokens (provided by you) to interact with your personal accounts on services like X (Twitter), YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok for purposes such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Posting content (e.g., tweeting, uploading YouTube videos, posting to Instagram/TikTok).</li>
                <li>Accessing your account's own data (e.g., your own follower count, your own video analytics, if configured and permitted by the respective APIs).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Local Storage:** Temporarily store data or configuration settings locally on your machine for the Application's operation (e.g., API keys, refresh tokens, last fetched data points). This data is not transmitted to us or any third party unless explicitly configured by you to do so for a specific service (e.g., uploading a video to YouTube).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>The Application **does not share any data collected or processed with any third parties** other than the services it directly interacts with at your explicit instruction (e.g., sending a tweet to Twitter, uploading a video file to YouTube). We do not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose any information.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your API keys and tokens is your responsibility. The Application relies on you to store these credentials securely on your local machine (e.g., via environment variables or a secure configuration file). We are not responsible for the security of your system or any unauthorized access to your credentials.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in the Terms of Service, the Application interacts with various third-party services. This Privacy Policy only covers the Application itself. Please refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for information on their data collection and usage practices:</p>
    <ul>
